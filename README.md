# Winnipeg_Transit_API_Handler
A Python-based API handler for the Winnipeg Transit API. Currently it only finds stops near a geolocation and finds estimated bus times for a given stop number. My end goal is to make this a fully-fledged API handler that can access any features of the Winnipeg Transit API.
